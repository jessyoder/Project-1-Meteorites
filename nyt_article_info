Researchers propose a new model to explain the formation of most of the meteorites that make it to Earth.,Small Worlds With Lava Oceans Might Have Given Us Meteorites,"“Droplets of fiery rain.” That’s how Henry Clifton Sorby, a 19th-century British mineralogist, described the tiny spheres called chondrules found within meteorites. Chondrules are such dominant features of these meteorites that they are called chondrites, and they account for 86 percent of meteorites that have been found on Earth.",2020-06-22T09:00:20+0000,Researchers propose a new model to explain the formation of most of the meteorites that make it to Earth.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/science/meteorites-chondrites-chondrules.html
A study says the DART mission’s collision with an asteroid near Earth may liberate enough debris to reach Earth’s atmosphere.,This NASA Mission May Cause an Artificial Meteor Shower,"If all goes to plan, in September 2022 a NASA spacecraft, the Double Asteroid Redirection Test mission or DART, will slam into a space rock with the equivalent energy of three tons of TNT. The goal is to nudge the orbit of its target object ever-so-slightly, a practice run to see if we could divert an asteroid from a catastrophic impact with our planet in the future.",2020-05-13T09:00:29+0000,A study says the DART mission’s collision with an asteroid near Earth may liberate enough debris to reach Earth’s atmosphere.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/science/meteor-shower-nasa-dart.html

"For researchers using delicate, one-of-a-kind equipment, the extreme conditions at the bottom of the planet pose special challenges.",Antarctica vs. Science,"At the start of January, the same month the world marked the 200th anniversary of the discovery of Antarctica, scientists on snowmobiles were zipping across its diamantine ice, dragging a rig of metal detectors in their wake. Researchers were hoping to discover a hypothesized cache of iron-rich meteorites, the remnants of ancient asteroids and would-be planets, under the frozen wastes.",2020-05-02T09:00:19+0000,"For researchers using delicate, one-of-a-kind equipment, the extreme conditions at the bottom of the planet pose special challenges.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/science/antarctica-science-equipment.html

A meteoroid that grazed the night sky over Australia in 2017 took a very unusual path away from Earth.,This Fireball Ignored the Solar System’s One-Way Signs,"It’s not unusual for meteors to illuminate night skies over southwestern Australia’s desolate landscapes. But the fireball of July 7, 2017, was different. For a full minute and a half, it just kept burning and burning and burning. The object carved a trace of light as wide across as Texas, then faded.",2020-03-30T19:25:24+0000,A meteoroid that grazed the night sky over Australia in 2017 took a very unusual path away from Earth.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/science/fireball-meteor-australia.html

"In this lesson, students explore how locations around a meteorite provide information about the meteorite’s orbit. They then learn about triangulation techniques, create imaginary cities in which meteorites are ensconced, and provide clues by which triangulation can determine the hidden location of the meteorites. They also write letters in support of additional funding for meteor research.",Mapping Meteorites,Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.,2003-05-13T06:15:00+0000,"In this lesson, students explore how locations around a meteorite provide information about the meteorite’s orbit.
